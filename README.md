The deliverables can be found in the Final Analysis folder.

The Jupyter notebooks used to conduct the analyses are called FinalVacation and FinalWeather.

In the FinalVacation notebook, the humidity map and hotel map were created successfully. However, I was unable to figure out a way for these same two maps to print in GitHub.

The .png files can be found in the FinalOutPutData folder.
